# Shaders-GLSL</br>

Shaders that I wrote for my portfolio website project.</br>

I made these shaders to use in my portfolio web project. In order to keep
them simple and optimized, I used a pregenerated perlin noise texture.

I used Shader Toy extension in VsCode to shader preview. This code is
almost compitable with Shader Toy website. For details see the [Shader Toy
extension github repository.](https://github.com/stevensona/shader-toy)
